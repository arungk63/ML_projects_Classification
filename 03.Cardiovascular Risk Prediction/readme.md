Objective
* Develop a predictive model that assesses the Cardiovascular Risk .
* The dataset is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has a 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). The dataset provides the patientsâ€™ information. It includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes.
* In this project, we will be working on predicting the 10-year risk of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD). We are given a set of variables that impact heart diseases. These variables are related to demographic, past, and current medical history
