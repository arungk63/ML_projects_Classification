Objective
To predict the wine quality using the machine learning algorithm.
Study the variables in the data set like fixed acidity, volatile acidity, alcohol content etc. Brief description shared along with data is given in the table below
Analyze these data through classifier algorithm and predict the quality of wine on score from 3 to 8 or bad-good .check the output obtained through the model for correctness and optimize the model based on performance
Three Machine learning classification algorithms are considered in this project 

* Random forest 

* Logistic regression

* Naive bayes
